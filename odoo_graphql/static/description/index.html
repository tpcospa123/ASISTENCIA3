        <p>Graphql provides a simplier and more efficient way to query data than you would currently do in Odoo (using for example xmlrpc or jsonrpc).</p>
        <p>
          This module adds a generic way to do graphql queries and mutations on Odoo server.<br>
          This module takes into account any installed modules and use the Odoo permissions (Access rights and access rules).

      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use Odoo as your centralised database for your automations.<br>
          Odoo has the easiest backend framework to develop with, and an active and growing community<br>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to create your own website on top of Odoo using the most modern framework as AngularJS, VueJS or ReactJs,<br>
          This module will provide you the simpliest and most efficient way to do your queries.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="text-danger">DISCLAIMER:</span> To do your own website using Odoo, you will need to handle cors.<br>
          More informations are provided on the readme when you download this module, but you can already have the main informations here:

      <h2>What are the differences with other solutions?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Flat Learning curve</strong>: The GraphQL arguments are done in a way that any Odoo developer will feel at home.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Genericity</strong>: You don't want to update your GraphQL models for each module you install.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintainance</strong>: You don't want to duplicate your code, as Odoo Model AND GraphQL model.
          You also don't want to update your GraphQL models for each module you install.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance</strong>: By coding it yourself, you <span>MAY</span> have better performances, but you will <span>PROBABLY</span> have lower ones. The query processing is made as best as it can be by wrapping Odoo's ORM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spare Time (and thus money)</strong>: You want to focus on the use of the data, not how you gather them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Security and Performance</h2>
      <p>
        The security policy is the one already defined by Odoo.
        You cannot get more informations using GraphQL than you would using jsonrpc/xmlrpc.
        (This module will be extendend with a per-fields access policy in a near future, but as long as RPC is allowed, this won't be any game-changer in term of security)
        Those security policies must not be by-passed, which may be done by a developer for any (bad) reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        The security policies in Odoo add an overhead on each requests.
        This module optimise the search, especially for multi-level queries.

      <h4>Need to know the available types? No worries!</h4>
      The route <strong>/graphql/schema</strong> will provide you with all the types you can query.<br/>
      Accessing this url through a web-browser will download the schema in a file.<br/>
      <br/>
      Nb: This feature is under development. The goal is to be compliant with a graphql editor as GraphiQL.<br/>
